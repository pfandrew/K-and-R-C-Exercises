//Exercise 2-1: Write a program to determine the ranges of char, short, int and long variables, both signed and unsigned, by printing appropriate values from standard headers and by direct computation. Harder if you compute them: determine the ranges of the various floating-point types.

//Note: This program just computes them. There are two ways to compute them: taking number of bits and converting max/min binary to decimal, or just counting. Both methods are employed.

	/*due to strange weirdness, I was not able to manually convert binary into floating point. 
	for instance, sizeof(float) gives 4 bytes, yet strangely a variable such as "float f" could store 8 bytes! 
	And it did not seem to have: 1) a sign bit, 2) an exponent bit string or 3) a significand bit string. 
	No manipulations to the string could result in a negative floating point number on my machine, 
	or a change in the point position. 
	
	In other words, float f = 0b11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 (64 bits) 
	simply out puts a 64 bit number. I assume some conversion to double must be occuring underneath the hood, since floats
	cannot store 64 bits of data.
	
	Will update this exercise as I learn more about floating point computation on my computer.*/

# TCPL-Exercises-Kernighan-Ritchie
Updating as I complete exercises from the C Programming Language, by Kernighan and Ritchie

Solutions use only language features presented up to that point in the book.

Source files with prefix "ex_" are my original solutions. All other source files are copied (with minor changes) directly from the book, and have references to the sections that they come from.

Lots of solutions are very messy/ugly, I appreciate any feedback as I am still a beginner.

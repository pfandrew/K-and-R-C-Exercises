# TCPL-Exercises-Kernighan-Ritchie

Solutions use only language features presented up to that point in the book, excepting the use of some multidimensional arrays and some recursion before they are introduced.

Source files with prefix "ex_" are my original solutions. Some of them use functions like reverse() which are copied directly out of the book to aid with the solution. All other source files that do not have the prefix "ex_" are copied (with minor changes) directly from the book, and therefore have references to the sections that they come from.

I appreciate any feedback on these solutions!
